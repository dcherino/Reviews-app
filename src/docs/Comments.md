# Comments about the project

## Redux toolkit

I believe that the project is very simple and Redux is not really necessary here. It should be enough managing the state with the new React Context.

However, I decided to use Redux for two main reasons:

* Mainly, to show my ability to use Redux. I think that Redux is being used within the company and I wanted to show that I'm familiar with the library.

* Secondly, to show my ability to use the new Redux Toolkit which simplifies things and it needs much less configuration.

## Styled components

Although I think that for this project would be easier using CSS Modules, I decided to use Styled components in order to show that I'm familiar with this CSS-in-JS styling framework.

## Design

I created the design from scratch using Photoshop and Figma. Although I browsed the Internet to get some inspiration, it is a totally original design. It is a fully responsive design with very intuitive elements for the user.

# Comments about the project


## Redux toolkit

The application is not really big and Redux is not really necessary here. React Context should be enough managing the state in this case. However, I decided to use Redux for three main reasons:

* Mainly, to show my ability to use Redux. I think that Redux is being used within the company and I wanted to show that I'm familiar with the library.

* Redux allows us to scalate the app easily without big refactoring.

* Also, to show my ability to use the new Redux Toolkit which simplifies things and it needs much less configuration.

## Styled components

Although I think that for this project would be easier using CSS Modules, I decided to use Styled components in order to show that I'm familiar with this CSS-in-JS styling framework.

## Design

I created the design from scratch using Photoshop and Figma. The result is a beautiful user-experience. Although I browsed the Internet to get some inspiration, it is a totally original design. It is a fully responsive design with very intuitive elements for the user.

## Improvements

More than improvements, I would like to added a option to sort and filter reviews but I ran out of time. For sure I will add them in my spare time independently of the recruitment proccess.
